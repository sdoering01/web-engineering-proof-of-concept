# Web-Engineering Proof of Conecpt

Proof of Concept for the lecture "Web-Engineering" in my Master's degree. For now this only includes the web frontend without backend access.

The idea is to create a todo list that can track dependencies between todos, so that the user can see all currently relevant todos at one glance.
